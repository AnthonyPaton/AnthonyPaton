- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AnthonyPaton
I'm a classically trained chef with over 30 years of experience, time to hang up my apron for the last time.
I started coding mid 2022, I enjoy getting stuck into any project and thrive incredibly well under pressure that's time sensitive.
I work well as an individual and in a team. Very easy going with a wicked sense of humour and very adaptable.
